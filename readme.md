Sequence Pattern Analysis Tool (SPAT)
=====================================
This tool was made for the [Fuchs lab](http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/fuchs/) at Tufts university. The program, which utilizes a python backend and react frontend. The program uses biopython and the xStream algorithm to detect underlying features in DNA sequences that lead to repetitive proteins. 

Simply running gulp and python should be sufficient to run this locally.

Since the creation of this tool, another library, named [TRAL](http://elkeschaper.github.io/tral/) has been published which achieves the goals of this tool, but with far greater community support. As such, the tool is not actively maintained.
